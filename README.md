# Predicting Hospital Readmittance
The files connected to the final group project for the DSBA 6156 (Applied Machine Learning) in the Fall 2019 semester.

The project used medical records from the MIMIC-III dataset to predict readmittance (readmittance is defined as returning to the emergency room within 30 days of discharge). The primary analysis for this project was analytzing digitized medical reports with natural language processing techiniques from the Scikit-Learn library.

Furthermore, the dataset was highly inbalanced. This required using adaptive synthetic oversampling techinques (ADASYN).
